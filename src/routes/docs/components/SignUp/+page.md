# <code>&lt;SignUp /&gt;</code> Component

Renders a sign-up form. The functionality of the `<SignUp />` component is controlled by the instance settings you specify in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com).

Accepts a `redirectUrl` prop that specifies where the user will be sent after signing up.

See the [Clerk docs](https://clerk.com/docs/references/javascript/clerk/sign-up) for all available props.
