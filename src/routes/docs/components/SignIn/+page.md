# <code>&lt;SignIn /&gt;</code> Component

Renders a sign-in form. The functionality of the `<SignIn />` component is controlled by the instance settings you specify in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com).

Accepts a `redirectUrl` prop that specifies where the user will be sent after signing in.

See the [Clerk docs](https://clerk.com/docs/references/javascript/clerk/sign-in) for all available props.
